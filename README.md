# Learning how to interact with Large Language Modelsâ€‹

This repo is for the AI Tour workshop: Learning how to interact with Large Language Models

## Session Desciption

This lab provides a hands-on and engaging learning opportunity for working with Large Language Models. Learn how to use methods such as few-shot learning and chain of thought. See the creative possibilities of generative AI for image creation and multi-modal scenarios, master the skill of function calling and understand how the model can apply existing knowledge.

## Learning Outcomes
