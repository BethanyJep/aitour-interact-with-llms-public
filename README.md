# Interacting with Large Language Modelsâ€‹

This repository is for the AI Tour workshop: Interacting with Large Language Models

## Session Desciption

This lab provides a hands-on and engaging learning opportunity for working with Large Language Models. Learn how to use methods such as few-shot learning and chain of thought. See the creative possibilities of generative AI for image creation and multi-modal scenarios, master the skill of function calling and understand how the model can apply existing knowledge.

## Learning Outcomes
* Understand how Large Language Models work, including what tokens areâ€‹
* Explore Prompt Engineering techniques and best practicesâ€‹
* Understand how models apply existing knowledgeâ€‹
* Implementing function calling in LLM applicationsâ€‹
* Get started with building an Azure AI assistant

## Technology Used
* Azure AI Studio
